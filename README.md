The first step in coming up with an idea for this app, was identifying a problem that could be solved. The focus was to provide a benefit for the user.  Next, wireframes were used to design the app and show how the data would be displayed.  The trello board helped to organize what needed to be accomplished.

## Requirements
Have at least 2 models (coach/user and client)
